        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Here we're serving it with a simple quick pasta, but its uses are endless. I use it interchangeably as a</p>  
        <p>vegan “bechamel” - to use in vegan lasagnas, mousaka, as a sauce for baked shells or baked pasta, you</p>
        <p>get the idea.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>5 ounces dry pasta, cooked to package direction</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh peas (or frozen, or sub snow peas or steamed broccoli)</li>
            <li>optional: 8 ounces mushrooms, sauteed, or try smoked mushrooms!</li>
