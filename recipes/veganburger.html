        <p>Full of flavor… and totally vegan!</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients for the patty</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large portobello mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon Miso ( any color)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sriracha</li>
            <li>pinch of salt and pepper</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prep the portobellos!  Make the flavorful marinade. The umami flavored miso paste, blended with sriracha and sesame oil is delicious on portobello mushrooms!</li>
            <li>Make the cucumber ribbon salad!</li>
            <li>Cut baby cumbers into thin ribbons using a mandolin or veggie peeler. Or just cut them into thin disks, no problem! Season with the dressing!</li>
            <li>Make the quick carrot slaw. I just used store-bought match stick carrots for this , but feel free to grate a carrot! You can also sub this Asian Slaw!</li>
            <li>Make the Ginger Sesame Avocado Spread…. or “Asian Guacamole”.</li>
            <li>Mash up a large avocado with fresh ginger, sesame oil and a splash of rice vinegar.</li>
            <li>Grill the portobello mushrooms for the burgers. I always start with tops down…they'll dry out less.  Grill for 4-5 minutes over medium heat, giving them a nice sear,  flip and cook for a couple more minutes. If you are particular like me, collect the juice from the mushroom caps  before flipping and use that to baste the tops.</li>
            <li>Toast the buns! This is essential…..it keeps them from getting soggy!</li>
            <li>Assemble the Portobello Burgers!</li>
